# This is for Installing the LibreOffice app for Ubuntu(deb)

I did download this form the official app, and in this github repo i will try to make a script for automatically install this in my Ubutnu os.

The Official Download Page is:
[Page Link](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/)

LibreOffice_25.2.4_Linux_x86-64_deb.tar.gz (199 MB)



# How i am making the release

I only need to keep the tar.gz file.

I need to make sure the folder contains the extracted files should not be present here.

To make the release zip i will keep the latest official arechieve file in my repo main directory and then make the script which will do all things.
